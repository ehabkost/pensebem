Scour
=====

Scour is a Python module that takes an input SVG and outputs a cleaner, 
more concise SVG file.  The goal is that authors will use this script after
editing the file in a GUI editor such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

Scour was started as a vehicle for me to learn Python.  In addition, the goal
is to reduce the amount of time I spend in cleaning up files I find on sites
such as openclipart.org

Ideas are pulled from three places:

- my head
- Sam Ruby's SVG Tidy script: http://intertwingly.net/code/svgtidy/svgtidy.rb
- Inkscape's proposal for a 'cleaned SVG': http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Save_Cleaned_SVG
